The way Pathom consumers GraphQL is by first adapting a GraphQL schema to the Pathom
format.

## How Pathom translates from GraphQL

It's important to remember that Pathom and GraphQL use different base abstraction ideas.

While GraphQL is based typed schema, Pathom works with attributes directly.

Let's take a look in an example to see what this translation look like, let's take
this GraphQL schema as an example:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
}
```

When we connect to Pathom, it's required that you define a namespace to prefix all
the names that we will import from the GraphQL service.

For this example I'll pick the name `"gqldemo"`, this is what the import code looks
like:

```clojure
(p.gql/connect-graphql
  {::p.gql/namespace "gqldemo"}
  request-graphql-fn)
```

With that configuration, we should expect the following attributes to be available
from Pathom:

```clojure
:gqldemo.Query/me
:gqldemo.User/id
:gqldemo.User/name
```

An example query to fetch the name of the current user:

```clojure
[{:gqldemo.Query/me
  [:gqldemo.User/name]}]
```

### Scalars

Pathom doesn't do anything about scalars, in the context of Pathom integration with
GraphQL they are irrelevant.

### Object Types

For each object type in GraphQL, Pathom will add one attribute to hold the type itself
and one attribute for each property of that type in GraphQL.

Getting back to our previous example, for the type `User` we will have this:

```clojure
; type name
:gqldemo.types/User

; attributes for properties
:gqldemo.User/id
:gqldemo.User/name
```

It's important to note that `:gqldemo.types/User` is marked as a transient attribute.
This means you can't query for it, but it's part of the query resolution.

Having these types named allow us to reference the type (which means we can access
all attributes of it) in a simple way.

### Query Type

Query types are first defined in the same way as the object types. The special thing
about the Query type is that Pathom will make it accessible from anywhere, so you can
enter the GraphQL from its properties.

### Interfaces

From Pathom point of view, interfaces kinda work backwards. Pathom will find all the
implementations of the interface and link them will all implementor object types.

### Mutations

All mutations are imported all namespaced by the user prefix plus `.Mutation`, for
example:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  setMessage(message: String): String
}
```

Here is how we call it:

```clojure
[(gqldemo.Mutation/setMessage {:message "Some message"})]
```

:::note
The namespace at the mutation params are not relevant, with or without a namespace
Pathom will send them as-is.
:::

Depending on the mutation you may need to add a sub-query to satisfy the GraphQL
syntax.

Taking another example from GraphQL documentation:

```graphql
input MessageInput {
  content: String
  author: String
}

type Message {
  id: ID!
  content: String
  author: String
}

type Query {
  getMessage(id: ID!): Message
}

type Mutation {
  createMessage(input: MessageInput): Message
  updateMessage(id: ID!, input: MessageInput): Message
}
```

Using the same prefix as before, this is how we can call createMessage:

```clojure
[{(gqldemo.Mutation/createMessage {:id 123 :content "Some message" :author "Margaret"})
  [:gqldemo.Message/id
   :gqldemo.Message/content]}]
```

### Ident Mapping

Although the types are not a thing in Pathom, we make some attributes to represent those
types, so we can avoid copying all the type attributes over and over in all the places
which it is applicable.
