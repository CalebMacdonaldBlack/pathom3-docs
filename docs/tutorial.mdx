title: Pathom Tutorial

This is a practical tutorial to go over the basic functions of Pathom.

In this tutorial I'll demonstrate how to create a data model for a partial reddit clone.

```clojure
; db
:reddit.post/id
:reddit.post/link
:reddit.post/title
:reddit.post/text
:reddit.post/posted-at

:reddit.subreddit/name

:reddit.user/login

:reddit.comment/id
:reddit.comment/text
```

## Resolvers

Resolvers are the main building block on Pathom.
