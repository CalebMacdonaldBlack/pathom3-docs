## index-oir

This is the most important index to understand how Pathom processes the data.

The `oir` stands for `output` → `input` → `resolver`.

In other words, this is the index that tells Pathom which are the paths available to
reach a given attribute in the system.

Let's look at an example and talk over it:

```clojure
; for this resolver
(pco/defresolver product-by-id [{:keys [acme.product/id]}]
  {::pco/output [:acme.product/name
                 :acme.product/price
                 :acme.product/in-stock?]})

; we get this index-oir
{::pci/index-oir
 {:acme.product/name      {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}
  :acme.product/price     {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}
  :acme.product/in-stock? {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}}}
```

With this index, Pathom can ask: How can I fetch `:acme.product/price` in the system?
For which the answer is:

```clojure
{#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}
```

Or in plain english: The index says you can fetch the product price, given you provide some
product id, using the edge `product-by-id`.

This is an overview of this index, for more details on how the planner uses it, check
