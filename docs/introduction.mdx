## Basic Concepts

**Pathom** is a Clojure/script library for building APIs more naturally shaped to your domain.
 Similar to libraries such as [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Falcor](https://netflix.github.io/falcor/), but
  modeled around attribute, rather than entity or object relationships. The following list includes
   the main broad concepts and constructs in Pathom:

### Attributes

Attributes are the main drivers of Pathom logic, and are first class citizens.  For example in Pathom,
`:user/first-name` stands on it's own. In contrast to other approaches where defining `User.firstName` means that
`firstName` has no meaning outside the context of a User object.  In Pathom you express the relationship
of attributes via resolvers.

### Resolvers

Resolvers are building blocks that establish relationships between attributes.  Pathom's secret sauce is
navigating a graph of resolvers to determine the set that are necessary to service a given request.

### Environment

Is a map containing all the necessary context required to process a request.  The environment map is
handled using Clojure best practices.  Data for Pathom internals uses Pathom-specific namespaced keys,
and you will typically add your own entries (database connections, etc.) such that all these data are
available to your resolvers.

### Planner

Given the environment, some initial data and a request, the planner is responsible for figuring what
resolvers to call, in what order.

### Runner

Once the plan is ready the runner executes the plan, by traversing and executing resolvers, then
shaping the results to satisfy the request.  It handles errors as well as potential conflicts
(e.g. multiple resolvers can handle a given request).

### Interfaces

Pathom requests can executed via [EQL](https://github.com/edn-query-language/eql) queries or, new in Pathom 3, Smart Maps.  EQL, inspired by Datomic's pull syntax,
allows you to express queries with Clojure/script data structures that represent both the data content and shape
needed by a client.  Smart Maps take this even further by allowing you work with Clojure/script maps that are transparently
associated with Pathom resolvers.

## Install

Find the instructions to include Pathom as a dependency in the [Clojars page](https://clojars.org/com.wsscode/pathom3).

## Namespace aliases

When you read code from the examples in this documentation they will use alias to reference
namespaces, here you can find what the aliases point to:

```clojure
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.built-in.resolvers :as pbir]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes :as pci]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.operation :as pco]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.planner :as pcp]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.runner :as pcr]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.eql :as p.eql]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.smart-map :as psm]
```
