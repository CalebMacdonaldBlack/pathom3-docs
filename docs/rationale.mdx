title: Rationale
---

To understand the reasoning around Pathom, let's split our definition of code in two types: Implementors and Composers.

## Schema

## Accessors

## Implementors

Those are functions that do actual work, like:

- Reading data from a database
- Transforming data
- Running calculations

This is to me where most of the fun in coding is, the real specific logic about your
application.

## Why Pathom?

I did

### Automated Controllers

* A lot of errors in software come from small mistakes when connecting functions in controllers

### Clojure/script solution

* With support
