## Basic Concepts

**Pathom** is a Clojure/script library to model attribute relationships. The following
list includes the main broad concepts and constructs in Pathom:

### Attributes

Attributes are the main drivers of Pathom logic. In Pathom you express the relationship
of attributes via resolvers.

### Resolvers

Resolvers are building blocks to establish relationships between attributes.

### Environment

Is a map containing all the necessary context required to process a request.

### Planner

Given some initial data and a request, the planner is responsible for figuring what
resolvers to call, in what order.

### Runner

One the plan is ready, the runner is going to execute the plan, it checks if the
responses are coming as expected and chooses the path when multiple options
are available.

### Interfaces

The interfaces are forms to make requests to Pathom. There is the Smart Map and the
EQL interfaces available.

## Install

Find the instructions to include Pathom as a dependency in the [Clojars page](https://clojars.org/com.wsscode/pathom3).

## Namespace aliases

When you read code from the examples in this documentation they will use alias to reference
namespaces, here you can find what the aliases point to:

```clojure
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.built-in.resolvers :as pbir]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes :as pci]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.operation :as pco]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.planner :as pcp]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.runner :as pcr]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.eql :as p.eql]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.smart-map :as psm]
```
