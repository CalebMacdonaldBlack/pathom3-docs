Here you will find information about built-in plugins.

```clojure

```

## Resolve mutations params

On Pathom, when you call a mutation, the params flow without any alteration. The default
behavior is meant to give the fastest path possible to invoke mutations.

That said, it's common also to want the params to be "resolved", just like Pathom does
with inputs on resolvers.

To make that happen, you can use the `mutation-resolve-params` built-in plugin. When
you add this plugin, Pathom will use the `::pco/params` as a query and will run that
on the user params, and then deliver the resolved data to the mutation.

Example:

```clojure
(pco/defmutation foo [{:keys [b]}]
  {:res b})

(p.eql/process
  (-> (pci/register
        [(pbir/single-attr-resolver :a :b inc)
         foo])
      (p.plugin/register pbip/mutation-resolve-params))
  ['(foo {:a 1})])
; => {foo {:res 2}}
```

:::tip
When using `pco/defmutation`, `::pco/params` is inferred from the argument destructuring.
