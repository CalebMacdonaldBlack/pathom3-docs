## index-oir

This is the most important index to understand how Pathom processes the data.

`oir` stands for `output` → `input` → `resolver`.

In other words, this is the index that tells Pathom which are the paths available to
reach a given attribute in the system.

Let's look at an example and talk over it:

```clojure
; for this resolver
(pco/defresolver product-by-id [{:keys [acme.product/id]}]
  {::pco/output [:acme.product/name
                 :acme.product/price
                 :acme.product/in-stock?]}
  (fetch-product id))

; we get this index-oir
{::pci/index-oir
 {:acme.product/name      {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}
  :acme.product/price     {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}
  :acme.product/in-stock? {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}}}
```

With this index, Pathom can ask: How can I fetch `:acme.product/price` in the system?
For which the answer is:

```clojure
{#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}
```

Or in plain english: The index says you can fetch the product price, given you provide some
product id, using the edge `product-by-id`.

This is an overview of this index, for more details on how the planner uses it, check
the [planner page](planner.mdx).

## index-io

This index tells, for given attribute set (with empty, one or more items), which attributes
are **directly reachable** (one resolver distance) from that set.

`io` stands for `input` → `output`.

Here is what `index-io` looks like, using the same resolver from our previous example:

```clojure
{::pci/index-io
 {#{:acme.product/id}
  {:acme.product/name      {}
   :acme.product/price     {}
   :acme.product/in-stock? {}}}}
```

The `output` part uses the [shape descriptor](shape-descriptor.mdx) format.

[Smart maps](smart-maps.mdx) use this index to figure reachable attributes when used in "reachable mode".

This is a good index to create auto-complete features in editors for Pathom integration.

## index-attributes

This index contains accumulated information about how a specific attribute relates to
other attributes and resolvers.

Let's use the `full-name` resolver example to demonstrate the index-attributes at play:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver full-name [{::keys [first-name last-name]}]
  {::full-name (str first-name " " last-name)})

{::pci/index-attributes
 {#{::first-name ::last-name} {:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-id       #{::first-name ::last-name}
                               :com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-provides {::full-name #{:full-name}}
                               :com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-input-in #{full-name}}
  ::first-name                {:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-id           ::first-name
                               :com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-combinations #{#{::first-name ::last-name}}
                               :com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-input-in     #{full-name}}
  ::last-name                 {:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-id           ::last-name
                               :com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-combinations #{#{::first-name ::last-name}}
                               :com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-input-in     #{full-name}}
  ::full-name                 {:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-id        ::full-name
                               :com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-reach-via {#{::first-name ::last-name} #{full-name}}
                               :com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-output-in #{full-name}}}}
```

The first level of the index is the attribute itself, the details we can explain key by
key:

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-id`

Contains the ID of the attribute, it may be a keyword (as seen in the example) or also
a set in cases of attribute combinations.

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-input-in`

A set containing a list of all resolvers in which this attribute appears as an input.

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-output-in`

A set containing a list of all resolvers in which this attribute appears as an output.

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-provides`

This is a sub-index, telling what other attributes are reachable from this attribute, by
which resolver.

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-reach-via`

This is a sub-index, telling what other attributes you can use to reach the current, by
which resolver.

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/attr-combinations`

A set with all the input combinations that this attribute appears in.
