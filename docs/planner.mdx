Welcome to the heart of Pathom. The planner is the part of Pathom that figures which
resolvers to call, in which order to fulfill the data demand.

## What is a plan?

The Pathom plan is a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), and it
looks like this:

GRAPH HERE



To compute the plan, Pathom requires:

- [Indexes](indexes.mdx)
- [EQL AST](https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/specification.html) of the demand

Pathom represents the plan DAG using plain Clojure maps.

Here you can see an example to get a more concrete sense of what a plan looks like:

```clojure
(ns com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes :as pci]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.operation :as pco]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.planner :as pcp]
            [edn-query-language.core :as eql]))

; start with a simple resolver
(pco/defresolver answer []
  {::answer-to-everything 42})

; create indexes
(def indexes (pci/register answer))

; generate execution DAG
(let [ast (eql/query->ast [::answer-to-everything])]
  (pcp/compute-run-graph
    (assoc indexes
      :edn-query-language.ast/node ast)))
```

Generates this plan:

```clojure
{::pcp/nodes
 {1
  {::pco/op-name
   com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner/answer

   ::pcp/node-id
   1

   ::pcp/requires
   {:com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner/answer-to-everything {}}

   ::pcp/input
   {}

   ::pcp/source-for-attrs
   #{:com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner/answer-to-everything}}}

 ::pcp/index-resolver->nodes
 {com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner/answer #{1}}

 ::pcp/unreachable-resolvers
 #{}

 ::pcp/unreachable-attrs
 #{}

 ::pcp/index-ast
 {:com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner/answer-to-everything
  {:type         :prop
   :dispatch-key :com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner/answer-to-everything
   :key          :com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner/answer-to-everything}}

 ::pcp/root
 1

 ::pcp/index-attrs
 {:com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.planner/answer-to-everything 1}}
```

Time to break down the attributes here:

#### `::pcp/nodes`

Contains a map with all the nodes from this graph, indexed by `node-id`. The `node-id`
is a monotonic incremental value, the first node gets the ID 1.

In case you already have some data available, you can tell the planner about it so it will
take that in consideration when formulating the plan.

It can also take optionally a [Shape Descriptor](shape-descriptor.mdx) with the available
attributes.
