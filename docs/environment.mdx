title: Environment
---

The environment is a map containing contextual information, both from Pathom itself
and from any user/library extensions.

In this page you will learn
Given the environment is a generic and open map, it makes more sense to talk about
what features of Pathom you can see and interact with.

You can always add more things to the environment to suite your own needs.

## Native features on environment

### Entity

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.entity-tree/entity-tree*`

This attribute contains the atom with the current entity data. As Pathom processes the
graph, new data gets merged into the entity.

You can find helpers to manipulate the entity in the `com.wsscode.pathom3.entity-tree`
namespace.

### Indexes

Indexes should be present in all environments, given they are the center for connect
processing

#### [`:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/index-attributes`](indexes.mdx#index-attributes)
#### [`:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/index-io`](indexes.mdx#index-io)
#### [`:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/index-oir`](indexes.mdx#index-oir)
#### [`:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes/index-resolvers`](indexes.mdx#index-resolvers)

For details on the indexes keys, check the [indexes page](indexes.mdx).

### Path

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.path/path`

This attribute tells you which is the path of the current run process. It is a vector
telling the path from left to right. The following example does a simple demonstration
of the path environment attribute.

```clojure
(ns com.wsscode.pathom.docs.environment-demo
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.built-in.resolvers :as pbir]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes :as pci]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.operation :as pco]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.eql :as p.eql]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.path :as p.path]))

(pco/defresolver env-path [{::p.path/keys [path]} _]
  {::p.path/path path})

(p.eql/process (pci/register [env-path
                              (pbir/constantly-resolver ::data
                                {::nested [{} {}]})])
  [::p.path/path
   {::data [::p.path/path
            {::nested [::p.path/path]}]}])
; => {::p.path/path
;     []
;
;     ::data
;     {::p.path/path
;      [::data]
;
;      ::nested
;      [{::p.path/path [::data ::nested]}
;       {::p.path/path [::data ::nested]}]}}
```

### Planner

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.planner/graph`

Contains the current execution plan in progress. You can find more details about the
plan graph at the [planner page](planner.mdx).

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.planner/node`

The current [execution node](planner.mdx#execution-node) for the plan. This is useful
to get more details from the resolver node run, like the parameters.

#### `:com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.planner/plan-cache*`

This is an optional attribute, when present the planner will cache plans on it.
