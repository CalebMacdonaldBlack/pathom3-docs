## Install

Find the instructions to include Pathom as a dependency in the [Clojars page](https://clojars.org/com.wsscode/pathom3).

## Namespace aliases

When you read code from the examples in this documentation they will use alias to reference
namespaces, here you can find what the aliases point to:

```clojure
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.built-in.resolvers :as pbir]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes :as pci]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.operation :as pco]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.planner :as pcp]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.runner :as pcr]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.eql :as p.eql]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.smart-map :as psm]
```

## Basic Concepts

### Attributes

Attributes are the main drivers of Pathom logic. In Pathom you express the relationship
of attributes via resolvers.

### Resolvers



### Environment

### Planner

### Runner

### Plugins

### Interfaces



**Pathom** is a Clojure/script library to model attribute relationships.

Attribute modeling is a way to think and design information systems.

Consider the question: What's the temperature in the city of Recife now?

Using my attribute modeler hat, I can break this description into two attributes and one
value. The demand is for a `:temperature`, and the available information is the
`:city` with the value of `Recife`. Or we can express it as a Clojure map:

```clojure
{:city        "Recife"
 :temperature ?}
```

Note we left `?` for the unknown attributes. In a way, this map expresses the same thing
as the question we had before.

Now, to realize the `:temperature` from the `city`, we write a resolver
establishing this relationship.

```clojure
; our mock temperatures database
(def temperatures
  {"Recife" 23})

(pco/defresolver temperature-from-city [{:keys [city]}]
  {:temperature (get temperatures city)})
```

A resolver looks like a function but with some constraints:

1. The resolver input **must** be a map, so the input information is labeled.
2. A resolver **must** return a map, so the output information is labeled.
3. A resolver may also receive another map, containing the environment information.

The next step is to create the indexes:

```clojure
(def indexes
  (pci/register [temperature-from-city]))
```

Pathom uses the indexes to traverse the attribute relationships.

Now to make the original question to Pathom, we are going to use the [Smart Map](smart-maps.mdx) interface:

```clojure
; this creates a smart map, using our indexes, and with some initial data
(def smart-map (psm/smart-map indexes {:city "Recife"}))

; smart maps work as regular maps when looking for the initial data
(:city smart-map); => "Recife"

; but the difference comes when we ask for keys not present in the map, but reachable
; via resolvers
(:temperature smart-map); => 23
```

:::important
Note that in this example, we only mention the indexes and the attributes, the resolver
names get abstracted from the user and left for Pathom to figure when to call then.
:::

Now consider a slightly different question: Is it cold in `Recife` now?

```clojure
{:city  "Recife"
 :cold? ?}
```

To compute the `:cold?` attribute, we can write a resolver that depends on the `:temperature`
attribute:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver cold? [{:keys [temperature]}]
  {:cold? (< temperature 20)})
```

Update the indexes definition to also include the `cold?` resolver:

```clojure
(def indexes
  (pci/register [temperature-from-city cold?]))
```

Now, back to the question: Is it cold in `Recife` now? This time we will use a different
interface, the [EQL](eql.mdx) interface.

```clojure
; this time we will use the EQL interface to trigger the Pathom engine
(p.eql/process
  indexes
  {:city "Recife"}
  [:cold?])
; => {:cold? false}
```

Note that our "lookup code" remains the same size, although we have to run more operations
now. This ability to abstract the function call chain is the primary utility you should
look for in Pathom.

In this getting started, we talked a bit about attribute modeling, how to write a few
resolvers and how to trigger the Pathom engine to fulfill attribute questions.
