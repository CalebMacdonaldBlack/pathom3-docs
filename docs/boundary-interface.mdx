This page will give you recommendation on how to expose a Pathom API as a service.

The most common case for this is serving Pathom as some HTTP API or putting Pathom
in the edge of some RPC call.

Pathom provides helper tools to use at those edges, here is an example of exposing
a Pathom as a [ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) handler:

```clojure
(ns )

(defn pathom-handler [{:keys [body]}]
  {:status 200
   :body   ()})
```

In those we will expect that we can only receive data
