title: Resolvers

:::tip
If you use [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/), you can ask it to resolve the
`pc/defresolver` as a `defn`, and you will get proper symbol resolution

:::tip
Pathom only looks at the last item of the body for implicit outputs, this means that
if you wrap the map with something like a `let` statement, Pathom will not be able
to figure it out. Instead, you can move the `let` down on the attribute level:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver foo []
  ; infer won't work, the last statement is a let
  (let [x 10]
    {:foo x}))

(pco/defresolver foo []
  ; works
  {:foo (let [x 10] x)})
```

In the future Pathom may get smarter around this, but this is a long rabbit role when
I consider that the last user statement may be an `if`, `cond`, etc...
