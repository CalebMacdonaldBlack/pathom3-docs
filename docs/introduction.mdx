**Pathom** is a Clojure/script library for logical data processing based on semantic
attributes.

With Pathom resolvers you will define relationships between attributes, and
let Pathom orchestrate the process.

## Main namespaces

Here is a list of the most common namespaces in Pathom 3 with their standard aliases,
and what they are for:

```clojure
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes :as pci]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.operation :as pco]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.built-in.resolvers :as pbir]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.eql :as p.eql]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.smart-map :as psm]
```
