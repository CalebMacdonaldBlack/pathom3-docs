title: Resolvers
---

Resolvers are the primary building blocks in Pathom. They are the constructs to express
relationships between attributes.

On this page, you will learn how to create resolvers and use then. After that you
will learn about the built-in resolvers that come with Pathom.

## What is a resolver in Pathom?

The Pathom engine gathers its resolution features from the relationship between attributes.
Resolvers are the piece that expresses those relationships.

To put in more concrete terms, imagine that you have some user id, and you want to know
the user's birth year. In Pathom, we express this relationship using the attributes
`:acme.user/id` and `:acme.user/birth-year` for example.

Now we need to implement how to fetch the name from the id, this can be a lookup in a
database, or a map, or any other way, doesn't matter. What matters is that you express
this connection and provide code that makes it happen.

Here I'll illustrate this using a map lookup:

```clojure
(def user-birthdays
  {1 1969
   2 1954
   3 1986})

; defresolver is the main option to create new resolvers
(pco/defresolver user-birthday [{:keys [acme.user/id]}]
  {:acme.user/birth-year (get user-birthdays id)})
```

In Pathom, resolvers represent edges in a graph. As illustrated in the following figure:

<div className="pathom-diagram">

  ![](./assets/diagrams/resolver.svg)

</div>

:::note
I made the names short on the diagrams for space, but [keep your domain qualifiers long](modeling-guides.mdx#attribute-domain-size)!
:::

This example was a simplification; most systems will store the full birth date instead,
and then extract the year from this date.

We can simulate such case using the following setup:

```clojure
; define a map for indexed access to user data
(def users-db
  {1 #:acme.user{:name     "Usuario 1"
                 :email    "user@provider.com"
                 :birthday "1989-10-25"}
   2 #:acme.user{:name     "Usuario 2"
                 :email    "anuser@provider.com"
                 :birthday "1975-09-11"}})

; pull stored user info from id
(pco/defresolver user-by-id [{:keys [acme.user/id]}]
  {::pco/output
   [:acme.user/name
    :acme.user/email
    :acme.user/birthday]}
  (get users-db id))

; extract birth year from birthday
(pco/defresolver birth-year [{:keys [acme.user/birthday]}]
  {:acme.user/birth-year (first (str/split birthday #"-"))})
```

Here is a diagram from the previous setup:

<div className="pathom-diagram">

  ![](./assets/diagrams/resolver-birthday-extended.svg)

</div>

Given that image, let's consider that we know about some user id and want to know
this user birthday, we can reach that using the path highlighted in the next diagram:

<div className="pathom-diagram">

  ![](./assets/diagrams/resolver-birthday-extended-highlight.svg)

</div>

So resolvers establish edges in the Pathom graph, allowing Pathom to traverse from
some source data to some target data. In the rest of this documentation, you will learn
how to define resolvers.

## Using `defresolver`

The macro `defresolver` is the primary way to create new resolvers. It has some sugars
to reduce the boilerplate code related to define a new resolver.

The main pieces of a resolver are:

- `::pco/op-name` - a symbol that identify the resolver, like a function name.
- `::pco/output` - a EQL expression that informs the attributes **provided** by this resolver.
- `::pco/input` - a EQL expression that informs the attributes **required** by this resolver.

Let's start with a verbose usage of `defresolver` to go over these main pieces:

```clojure
; this resolver computes a slug to use on URL from some article title
(pco/defresolver article-slug [env {:acme.article/keys [title]}]
  {::pco/op-name `article-slug
   ::pco/input   [:acme.article/title]
   ::pco/output  [:acme.article/slug]}
  {:acme.article/slug (str/replace title #"[^a-z0-9A-Z]" "-")})
```

:::note Design observation
This resolver expresses an edge in Pathom attribute world. It says the attribute `:acme.article/slug`
is reachable, given that a `:acme.article/title` is available.
:::

If you look close, you can find a fair amount of repetition in this expression:
- The `op-name` is repeated at the start to define the `var` name.
- The `input` is repeated in the destructuring expression.
- The `output` is visible in the output expression.

Experience with Pathom 2 demonstrated these repetitions occur frequently in most Pathom
code bases. So Pathom 3 adds some extra sugar tricks to avoid the repetition:

1. We can remove the `::pco/op-name` and let `defresolver` use the same symbol as the `var`:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver article-slug [env {:acme.article/keys [title]}]
  {::pco/input  [:acme.article/title]
   ::pco/output [:acme.article/slug]}
  {:acme.article/slug (str/replace title #"[^a-z0-9A-Z]" "-")})
```

:::tip
If you use [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/), you can ask it to resolve the
`pc/defresolver` as a `defn`, and you will get proper symbol resolution
:::

2. Now, given the `input` is the same as destructuring, we can let `defresolver` infer the input from it:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver article-slug [env {:acme.article/keys [title]}]
  {::pco/output [:acme.article/slug]}
  {:acme.article/slug (str/replace title #"[^a-z0-9A-Z]" "-")})
```

:::note
You can also use destructuring via symbol binding, for example, this works the same:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver article-slug [env {title :acme.article/title}]
  {::pco/output [:acme.article/slug]}
  {:acme.article/slug (str/replace title #"[^a-z0-9A-Z]" "-")})
```
:::

3. Since the last element of our expression is a map, `defresolver` can infer the `output` from it:

```clojure
; given the map would be empty now, we can remove it completely
(pco/defresolver article-slug [env {:acme.article/keys [title]}]
  {:acme.article/slug (str/replace title #"[^a-z0-9A-Z]" "-")})
```

:::important
Pathom only looks at the last item of the body for implicit outputs. This means that
if you wrap the map with something like a `let` statement, Pathom will not be able
to figure it out. Instead, you can move the `let` down on the attribute level:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver foo []
  ; infer won't work, the last statement is a let
  (let [x 10]
    {:foo x}))

(pco/defresolver foo []
  ; works
  {:foo (let [x 10] x)})
```

In the future, Pathom may get smarter around this, but this is a long rabbit role when
I consider that the last user statement may be an `if`, `cond`, etc...
:::

:::note
Although Pathom can infer the configuration, you can always override it using the
options map.
:::

4. Given we are not using `env`, we can also take it out, taking us to the final version:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver article-slug [{:acme.article/keys [title]}]
  {:acme.article/slug (str/replace title #"[^a-z0-9A-Z]" "-")})
```

:::tip
In case you have a resolver that doesn't use an input, you can omit the first argument
as well, for example:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver constant-pi []
  {:acme.math/pi 3.1415})
```
:::

## Invoking resolvers

Like functions, you can call the resolvers directly. The arity to call resolver is similar
to how to define resolvers:

```clojure
(pco/defresolver extension [{::keys [path]}]
  {::path-ext (last (str/split path #"\."))})

(extension {::path "foo.txt"})
; => {::path-ext "txt"}
```

This makes it easier to test resolvers in unit tests.

Outside of the test context, you should have little reason to invoke a resolver directly. What
sets resolvers apart from regular functions are that it contains data about its requirements
and what it provides.

This allows you to abstract away the operation names and focus only on the attributes.

To illustrate the difference, let's compare the two approaches, first let's define the resolvers:

```clojure
(ns com.wsscode.pathom.docs.resolvers-demos
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.built-in.resolvers :as pbir]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes :as pci]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.operation :as pco]
            [com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.smart-map :as psm]))

(def user-from-id
  (pbir/static-table-resolver `user-db :acme.user/id
    {1 #:acme.user{:name  "Trey Parker"
                   :email "trey@provider.com"}
     2 #:acme.user{:name  "Matt Stone"
                   :email "matt@provider.com"}}))

; avatar slug is a version of email, converting every non letter character into dashes
(pco/defresolver user-avatar-slug [{:acme.user/keys [email]}]
  {:acme.user/avatar-slug (str/replace email #"[^a-z0-9A-Z]" "-")})

(pco/defresolver user-avatar-url [{:acme.user/keys [avatar-slug]}]
  {:acme.user/avatar-url (str "http://avatar-images-host/for-id/" avatar-slug)})
```

Consider the question: What is the `avatar url` of the user with id `1`.

The traditional way to get there using our resolvers as functions goes as:

```clojure
(-> {:acme.user/id 1}
    (user-from-id)
    (user-avatar-slug)
    (user-avatar-url)
    :acme.user/avatar-url)
; => "http://avatar-images-host/for-id/trey-provider-com"
```

Now check a few examples of how we can accomplish the same using the a [smart map](smart-maps.mdx)
leveraged by the resolvers meta-data:

```clojure
; first, we build an index for the relations expressed by the resolvers
(def indexes
  (pci/register [user-from-id
                 user-avatar-slug
                 user-avatar-url]))

; now instead of reference the functions, we let Pathom figure them out using the indexes
(->> {:acme.user/id 2}
     (psm/smart-map indexes)
     :acme.user/avatar-url)
; => "http://avatar-images-host/for-id/matt-provider-com"

; to highlight the fact that we disregard the function, other ways where we can change
; the initial data and reach the same result:
(->> {:acme.user/email "other@provider.com"}
     (psm/smart-map indexes)
     :acme.user/avatar-url)
; => "http://avatar-images-host/for-id/other-provider-com"

(->> {:acme.user/avatar-slug "some-slogan"}
     (psm/smart-map indexes)
     :acme.user/avatar-url)
; => "http://avatar-images-host/for-id/some-slogan"
```

Note how as we change the input, Pathom adjusts the resolvers required to call, this
is the main thing that Pathom brings to you, **it removes the chore of knowing the
function names**, so you can focus on the data you have and need, instead of how to
get it.

## Generate the indexes

Here we will cover in more detail the process to generate the indexes from resolvers.

Think of resolvers as the **atomic blocks of Pathom**, which are annotated functions. If Pathom had to scan
every resolver to figure a path, it would be slow. So instead, Pathom works on indexes
generated from a set of resolvers.

To generate the indexes, we use the function `(pci/register ...)`. The values allowed
on `register` are:

- resolvers
- mutations
- indexes
- sequence of previous items (recursively)

Here are a couple of examples to illustrate:

```clojure
; create indexes for a single resolver
(def single-registry (pci/register some-resolver))

; creating indexes with a few resolvers
(def many-registry (pci/register [resolver-a resolver-b]))

; define a group of resolvers in a variable
(def some-resolvers [res-a res-b])

; now use in combination with other mixes:
(def more-registry
  (pci/register [some-resolvers
                 [other-group with-more
                  [deep-nested resolvers]]
                 and-more]))

; now using indexes as part of registry
(def with-indexes (pci/register [some-resolvers many-registry]))

; all together now
(def all-together
  (pci/register [[resolver-a resolver-b]
                 some-resolvers
                 many-registry]))
```

To learn more details about the indexes, check the [indexes page](indexes.mdx).

## Parameters

Parameters are a secondary layer to send information to a resolver. One main difference
between params and inputs is that params do not participate in the graph traversal; they
come as-is.

You can use parameters to allow the user to configure the request for some attribute.

To illustrate, lets start with a resolver that pulls todo from some mock memory data:

```clojure
(def mock-todos-db
  [{::todo-message "Write demo on params"
    ::todo-done?   true}
   {::todo-message "Pathom in Rust"
    ::todo-done?   false}])

(pco/defresolver todos-resolver [env _]
  ; express nested shape
  {::pco/output
   [{::todos
     [::todo-message
      ::todo-done?]}]}
  {::todos mock-todos-db})

(def env (pci/register todos-resolver))

; list all todos
(pf.eql/process env [::todos])
```

:::note
We are using explicit output in the `todos-resolver` so Pathom has more information about
the structured shape. Although the resolver works without the nested specification, having
it makes it possible for tools to auto-complete better, and this is important when
trying to integrate Pathom indexes, so as a general practice, when resolvers have nested
data, it's better always to specify it.
:::

To add params to a query attribute, we can use [EQL params](https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/specification.html#_parameters),
for example:

```clojure
; list undone todos:
(pf.eql/process env ['(::todos {::todo-done? false})])
```

If we just ran the previous code, nothing happens. To make this work, we need to use
the parameters to filter the data in the resolver code.

To pull the params we can use the helper `(pco/params env)`, then filter the list based
on it:

```clojure {14-18,22-24}
(def mock-todos-db
  [{::todo-message "Write demo on params"
    ::todo-done?   true}
   {::todo-message "Pathom in Rust"
    ::todo-done?   false}])

(pco/defresolver todos-resolver [env _]
  {::pco/output
   [{::todos
     [::todo-message
      ::todo-done?]}]}

  {::todos
   ; pull params and filter
   (if-some [done? (get (pco/params env) ::todo-done?)]
     (->> mock-todos-db
          (filter #(= done? (::todo-done? %))))
     mock-todos-db)})

(def env (pci/register todos-resolver))

; list undone todos
(pf.eql/process env
  '[(::todos {::todo-done? false})])
```

To use parameters with [Smart Maps](smart-maps.mdx) you need to call `sm-preload!` before
looking up the key, for example:

```clojure
(def sm (psm/smart-map env {}))

; preload using EQL params
(psm/sm-preload! sm '[(::todos {::todo-done? false})])

(::todos sm) ; => cached filtered li
```

:::tip
Example implementation using a more generic function to filter data:

```clojure
(defn filter-matches [match coll]
  (let [match-keys (keys match)]
    (if (seq match)
      (filter
        #(= match
            (select-keys % match-keys))
        coll)
      coll)))

(pco/defresolver todos-resolver [env _]
  {::pco/output
   [{::todos
     [::todo-message
      ::todo-done?]}]}

  {::todos
   (filter-matches (pco/params env) mock-todos-db)})
```
:::

## Using `resolver`

You can also create a resolver using the `resolver` helper. This is more useful when
you are making some helper function to generate a resolver.

To create a resolver using `pco/resolver` you have the following options:

```clojure
; using helper syntax
(pco/resolver `op-name
  {::pco/output [::foo]}
  (fn [env input] {::foo "bar"}))

; using config map
(pco/resolver
  {::pco/op-name `op-name
   ::pco/output  [::foo]
   ::pco/resolve (fn [env input] {::foo "bar"})})
```

As an example, here are how to generate resolvers to create unit conversion between
meters and foot to a given attribute name:

```clojure
(defn meter<->feet-resolver
  [attribute]
  (let [foot-kw  (keyword (namespace attribute) (str (name attribute) "-ft"))
        meter-kw (keyword (namespace attribute) (str (name attribute) "-m"))]
    [(pbir/single-attr-resolver meter-kw foot-kw #(* % 3.281))
     (pbir/single-attr-resolver foot-kw meter-kw #(/ % 3.281))]))

(let [sm (psm/smart-map (pci/register (meter<->feet-resolver :foo)))]
  [(-> sm (assoc :foo-m 169) :foo-ft)
   (-> sm (assoc :foo-ft 358) :foo-m)])
; => [554.489 109.11307528192624]
```

## Resolver environment

The environment is a map containing contextual information about the process. You can find
information about environment details at the [environment page](environment.mdx).
