## index-oir

This is the most important index for Pathom when it processes the data.

This `index-oir` stands for `output` → `input` → `resolver`.

It’s the index used by Connect to look up attributes. Pathom builds this index using the
input/output from the resolver when you register it.

This is what it looks:

```clojure
; for this resolver
(pco/defresolver product-by-id [{:keys [acme.product/id]}]
  {::pco/output [:acme.product/name
                 :acme.product/price
                 :acme.product/in-stock?]})

{::pci/index-oir
 {:acme.product/name      {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}
  :acme.product/price     {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}
  :acme.product/in-stock? {#{:acme.product/id} #{product-by-id}}}}
```
