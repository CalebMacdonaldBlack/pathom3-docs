title: Placeholders
---

Placeholders allow the user to add structure to some EQL request. They work as a special
attribute namespace, by default Pathom recognize any attribute with the namespace `>` as
a placeholder attribute.

:::note
You can configure the placeholder namespaces by setting the option `com.wsscode.pathom3.placeholder/placeholder-prefixes`
in the env, the default value is `#{">"}`.

In this guide you will go over a few examples on how to use placeholders.

## Provide initial data

You can use placeholders to provide in-query data for Pathom processing. To do this lets
get back to our famous full name example, the way to provide data is to send it to
a placeholder key as [EQL parameters](https://edn-query-language.org/eql/1.0.0/specification.html#_parameters):

```clojure
(pco/defresolver full-name [{::keys [first-name last-name]}]
  {::full-name (str first-name " " last-name)})

(def env (pci/register full-name))

(p.eql/process env
  [{'(:>/bret {::first-name "Bret" ::last-name "Victor"})
    [::full-name]}])
; => {:>/bret {:com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.placeholder/full-name "Bret Victor"}}
```

When moving to a placeholder context, Pathom inherits the same parent data and merges
the params data to it, to illustrate let's make a nested example of it:

```clojure
(p.eql/process env
  [{'(:>/bret {::first-name "Bret" ::last-name "Victor"})
    [::full-name
     {'(:>/bard {::first-name "Bard"})
      [::full-name]}]}])
; {:>/bret
;   {:com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.placeholder/full-name "Bret Victor",
;    :>/bard
;    {:com.wsscode.pathom3.docs.placeholder/full-name "Bard Victor"}}}
```

## Dashboard case - Spreading data in different paths

Consider a dashboard screen, like the following:



## Data Provider case

## Different parameters case



Reasons to want placeholders:

- Provide some extra data in-context.
