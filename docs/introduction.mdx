**Pathom** is a Clojure/script library for logical data processing based on semantic
attributes.

With Pathom resolvers you will define relationships between attributes, and
let Pathom orchestrate the process.

If you are new to the concepts of Pathom, please check the [Rationale](rationale) page
for information on the reasoning for Pathom.

## Main namespaces

Here is a list of the most common namespaces in Pathom 3 with their standard aliases,
and what they are for:

```clojure
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.indexes :as pci]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.operation :as pco]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.connect.built-in.resolvers :as pbir]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.eql :as p.eql]
[com.wsscode.pathom3.interface.smart-map :as psm]
